oneAPI DPC++ Library Guide
=================================

An introduction to the oneAPI DPC++ Library (oneDPL).

oneDPL aims to work with the oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler to
provide high-productivity APIs to developers, which can minimize Data Parallel C++ (DPC++) programming
efforts across devices for high performance parallel applications. oneDPL contains an additional set of library classes and functions that are referred to throughout this document as **Extension API**.
oneDPL consists of the following components:
