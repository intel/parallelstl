# Parallel STL 
[![Stable release](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-20180329-green.svg)](https://github.com/intel/parallelstl/releases/tag/20180329)
[![Apache License Version 2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache_2.0-green.svg)](LICENSE)

Parallel STL is an implementation of the C++ standard library algorithms with support for execution policies, 
as specified in the working draft N4659 for the next version of the C++ standard, commonly called C++17. 
The implementation also supports the unsequenced execution policy specified in the ISO* C++ working group paper P0076R3.

Parallel STL offers a portable implementation of threaded and vectorized execution of standard C++ algorithms, optimized and validated for Intel(R) 64 processors.
For sequential execution, it relies on an available implementation of the C++ standard library.

## Prerequisites

* C++ compiler with:
  * Support for C++11
  * Support for OpenMP* 4.0 SIMD constructs
* Intel(R) Threading Building Blocks (Intel(R) TBB) which is available to download in the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/01org/tbb/)
